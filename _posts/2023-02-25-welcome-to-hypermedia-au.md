## Welcome to my blog, I mean hello world.

Welcome to the first post in my blog here at hypermedia.au. I guess its time to introduce myself.

My name is Bruno, I live in Brisbane Australia and have been working in technology for my entire life, to properly introduce my journey would take a few posts, maybe something for another time.

I've spent most of the last 25 years working in the Web and Cloud spaces. Currently I work in cloud platform architecture and automation, most of my day-to-day takes place in the world of digital transformation.

My areas of expertise range from infrastructure and platform automation to software and solution architecture with a human twist. I am very passionate about designing and building technology that is fit for purpose and meets the needs of its users today and into the future.

I'm just testing out my blogging platform at the moment, so lets see if we can drop in a random code snippet:

```typescript
const myFunctionIsNice = (name: string): void => {
  console.log(`Hi there ${ name }, welcome to my blog!`)
}
```


<script src="https://utteranc.es/client.js"
        repo="[ENTER REPO HERE]"
        issue-term="pathname"
        theme="github-dark"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
</script>
